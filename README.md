# SvelteKit auth with GitHub OAuth

To set up you will need to create your own GitHub OAuth app, in GitHub
go to Settings > Developer settings > OAuth Apps > New OAuth App.

Set the Homepage URL to your localhost development port (example:
`http://localhost:3000/`) and the Authorisation Callback URL (example:
`http://localhost:3000/callback`)
